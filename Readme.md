![Tests](https://github.com/t54-labs/agentic-monoply/workflows/ðŸŽ®%20Monopoly%20Game%20Tests/badge.svg)

## Abstract

Agentic Monopoly represents a pioneering computational framework for investigating multi-agent economic behaviors through the lens of the classic Monopoly board game. This system implements a sophisticated agent economy simulation where autonomous AI agents engage in complex economic transactions, negotiations, and strategic decision-making processes. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) as the cognitive engine for each agent, the platform provides a rich environment for studying emergent economic behaviors, trading strategies, and inter-agent cooperation and competition dynamics.

The system architecture encompasses a distributed client-server model with real-time communication capabilities, comprehensive game state management, and detailed behavioral logging for subsequent analysis. Through this implementation, researchers can observe and analyze how autonomous agents develop trading strategies, negotiate complex multi-asset transactions, and adapt their behaviors in response to dynamic market conditions within a controlled yet realistic economic environment.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation and Research Context

The emergence of large language models has opened unprecedented opportunities for creating autonomous agents capable of sophisticated reasoning and decision-making. However, understanding how these agents behave in complex economic environments remains an active area of research. Traditional economic simulations often rely on predetermined behavioral models or simplified rule-based systems, limiting their ability to capture the nuanced decision-making processes that characterize real economic actors.

Monopoly, as a microcosm of economic activity, provides an ideal testbed for multi-agent economic research. The game incorporates fundamental economic concepts including property ownership, rent collection, strategic investment, resource management, and complex multi-party negotiations. These elements create a rich environment where agents must balance immediate gains against long-term strategic positioning, negotiate mutually beneficial trades, and adapt to changing market conditions.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This platform addresses several key research questions in multi-agent systems and computational economics:

1. **Emergent Trading Strategies**: How do LLM-based agents develop and refine trading strategies when operating in a competitive economic environment?

2. **Negotiation Dynamics**: What patterns emerge in multi-agent negotiations, particularly in scenarios involving asymmetric information and competing interests?

3. **Economic Adaptation**: How quickly and effectively do agents adapt their behaviors in response to changing market conditions and opponent strategies?

4. **Collective Intelligence**: Do groups of autonomous agents exhibit emergent collective behaviors that differ from individual agent strategies?

### 1.3 System Overview

The Agentic Monopoly platform consists of three primary subsystems:

- **Agent Intelligence Layer**: OpenAI GPT-4 powered autonomous agents with sophisticated reasoning capabilities

### 2.2 Agent Architecture

#### 2.2.1 Cognitive Framework
Each agent operates as an autonomous decision-making entity with the following capabilities:

```python
class OpenAIAgent(BaseAgent):
    def decide_action(self, game_state: Dict[str, Any], 
                     available_actions: List[str], 
                     current_gc_turn: int, 
                     action_sequence_num: int) -> Tuple[str, Dict[str, Any]]:
```

The agent cognitive process involves:
1. **State Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of current game state including player positions, property ownership, and market conditions
2. **Strategic Reasoning**: Long-term planning considering property monopolization potential and cash flow optimization
3. **Negotiation Logic**: Dynamic trading strategy formulation based on opponent behavior analysis
4. **Risk Assessment**: Probabilistic evaluation of action outcomes and potential countermeasures

#### 2.2.2 Decision Context Integration
Agents receive rich contextual information including:
- **Financial Status**: Current liquid assets, property portfolios, and debt obligations
- **Market Dynamics**: Property ownership distribution and rental income potential
- **Negotiation History**: Previous trade offers, acceptance/rejection patterns, and trust metrics
- **Opponent Modeling**: Inferred strategies and behavioral patterns of other agents

### 2.3 Game Logic Implementation

#### 2.3.1 State Management
The game controller maintains comprehensive state through several interconnected systems:

```python
class GameController:
    def __init__(self, num_players: int = 4, 
                 player_names: Optional[List[str]] = None,
                 game_uid: str = "default_game", 
                 ws_manager: Optional[Any] = None):
```

Core state components include:
- **Board Representation**: Dynamic property states with ownership tracking and improvement levels
- **Player Management**: Individual agent states including position, assets, and strategic context
- **Transaction Ledger**: Complete history of all economic activities for analysis and rollback
- **Decision Queue**: Asynchronous handling of simultaneous decision points (auctions, trades)

#### 2.3.2 Trading System Architecture
The platform implements a sophisticated multi-asset trading system supporting:

```python
@dataclass
class TradeOffer:
    trade_id: int
    proposer_id: int
    recipient_id: int
    items_offered_by_proposer: List[TradeOfferItem]
    items_requested_from_recipient: List[TradeOfferItem]
    status: str
    message: Optional[str] = None
